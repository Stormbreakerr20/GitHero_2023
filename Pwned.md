Have I Been Pwned? is a website that allows Internet users to check whether their personal data has been compromised by data breaches. The service collects and analyzes hundreds of database dumps and pastes containing information about billions of leaked accounts, and allows users to search for their own information by entering their username or email address. Users can also sign up to be notified if their email address appears in future dumps. The site has been widely touted as a valuable resource for Internet users wishing to protect their own security and privacy.

## Data breaches

Since its launch, the primary development focus of HIBP has been to add new data breaches as quickly as possible after they are leaked to the public.
In July 2015, online dating service [Ashley Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Madison), known for encouraging users to have extramarital affairs , suffered a data breach , and the identities of more than 30 million users of the service were leaked to the public. The data breach received wide media coverage, presumably due to the large number of impacted users and the perceived shame of having an affair.
